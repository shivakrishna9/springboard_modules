/**
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
 *
 * The exact implementation of a donor form as displayed to a user to
 * place a donation has been moved to an exterior module. (currently webform).
 * So long as we are using an exterior module to display the form we want,
 * the exact details will be handled by a glue module to link fundraiser
 * to whatever display implementation we use. This allows us future
 * flexibility and separation of concerns in code.
 *
 * As a result this module does not form_alter webform forms.
 * That's the glue's job. It also means that picking the workflow back up
 * of processing a donation is by executing a process call in fundraiser
 * from the submit in the glue module. So if you don't see a straight path
 * from one to the other in this module it's because the control of flow goes
 * into the glue module before coming back here.
 *
 * Donations themselves are also tracked in an exterior module
 * (currently commerce). A glue module is provided for this as well.
 * Donations are stored as orders in Commerce, and the glue module translates.
 * So the exterior module handling the purchasing stage of things is the one
 * that needs to be aware of things like states, user info, and the like.
 * To allow multiple gateways to be used depending on the fundraiser, fundraiser
 * does interact with a list of available gateways for use during processing.
 *
 * In practice this means, exterior modules are blind to each other,
 * and fundraiser is blind to them. The glue modules between them are the
 * only systems aware of more than one module at a time.

 * Alter client side validation of webform fields.

 * Fundraiser uses jQuery validation rules to handle client side validation

 * module to modify or extend these rules.
 *
 * Available validators:
 *   required: "This field is required",
 *   remote: "Please fix this field",
 *   email: "Enter a valid email address",
 *   url: "Enter a valid URL",
 *   date: "Enter a valid date",
 *   dateISO: "Enter a valid date (ISO)",
 *   number: "Must be a number", // changed
 *   digits: "Enter only digits",
 *   creditcard: "Enter a valid credit card number",
 *   equalTo: "Enter the same value again",
 *   accept: "Enter a value with a valid extension",
 *   maxlength: jQuery.validator.format("Enter no more than {0} characters"),
 *   minlength: jQuery.validator.format("Enter at least {0} characters"),
 *   rangelength: jQuery.validator.format("Enter a value between {0} and {1} characters long"),
 *   range: jQuery.validator.format("Enter a value between {0} and {1}"),
 *   max: jQuery.validator.format("Enter a value less than or equal to {0}"),
 *   min: jQuery.validator.format("Enter a value greater than or equal to {0}")
 *
 * Note: the "messages" property stores the return message to display if a
 * validator check fails.
 *
 * Example ruleset:
 * $settings['card_cvv'] = (object) array(
 *   'required' => TRUE,
 *   'number' => TRUE,
 *   'minlength' => 3,
 *   'maxlength' => 4,

/**
 * The fundraiser field API is an additional API that focuses on the creation,
 * handling and updating of fields in the fundraiser system. Since both
 * field display and charge processing are agnostic in this system,
 * we need a central location through which information about the fields
 * fundraiser expects may flow. The field_info array is it. Fundraiser builds
 * the array from it's own information and any information presented to it
 * by other modules. Other modules also have the opportunity to add validation
 * and submit routines for each of these fields, and will have access to the
 * submitted results according to the field keys given. This system is the
 * backbone of how one glue module may speak to and interact with the other.
 *
 * The #create_callback is used for fields whose settings are dependant
 * on the values given during field creation. For example, the amount field
 * could be displayed as a select box or as a text field depending on
 * fundraiser's settings. So the field callback checks during field creation
 * based on the associated fundraiser node to determine which.
 *
 * The #display_callback is an additional callback to allow another module
 * to override display from the glue module. This is useful if another module
 * can provide a more focused implementation of the form element than the
 * glue module can. For example, the charging module may be more aware of
 * available countries/states than the glue module, and can override
 * the creation and display to match this allowing for an AJAX interface.
