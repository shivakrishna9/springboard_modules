/**
 * @file
 *   A simple-as-possible migration of Commerce product and product display node
 *   information.
 *
 *   You can run this migration with
 *     drush mi FdMigrateProduct
 *     drush mi FdMigrateProductDisplay
 *
 *   To see the status of all migrations and what migrations are available:
 *     drush ms
 *
 *   To roll back migrations:
 *     drush migrate-rollback FdMigrateProductDisplay
 *     drush migrate-rollback FdMigrateProduct
 *
 *   Please make sure you don't get one of the products into the cart while
 *   you're rolling back, as this makes no end of messiness. Products in the cart
 *   are (not supposed to be able) to be deleted.
