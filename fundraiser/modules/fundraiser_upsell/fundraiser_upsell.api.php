/**
 * Some definitions.
 *
 * Original Donation or Upsold Donation
 *   The original one-time donation.
 *
 * Upsell Recurring Donation
 *   The recurring donation that is a result of being upsold.  In Salesforce
 *   terms this is the recurring donation object.  In Drupal terms this is
 *   the same as the upsell master donation.  Both objects have the same
 *   donation ID.  If using offsite recurring, then there is no recurring
 *   donation object in Salesforces and the data that would be included in
 *   the recurring donation object normally is instead stored on the master
 *   donation.
 *
 * Upsell Master Donation
 *   The donation that is the first in the sustainer series and is copied
 *   for the other donations in the series.
 *
 * Upsell (Slave) Donation
 *   The individual donations in the upsell sustainer series that are not the
 *   master donation.

 * Add your own settings to the fundraiser upsell area.

 * For example, adding custom salesforce and market source fields that would
 *   apply to only the upsell sustaienr series and not the original
 *   donation.  You'll need to add your own submit handler to modify or save
 *   the values.
 *
 * @param array $form
 *   The forms API array for the node add/edit page, after fundraiser_upsell
 *   has added its fields, but possibly before other form alters.
