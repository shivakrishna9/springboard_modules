Installing MyTube:

1. Copy this entire folder into your sites/all/modules folder.
2. Log in with an administrative account.
3. Go to Administration > Site Building > Modules and check the box labeled
   "MyTube".
4. MyTube will not automatically filter everything on the site. To enable
   filtering, see instructions in README.txt on enabling input filters.


Removing MyTube:

IMPORTANT: Do NOT remove MyTube without first ensuring all input formats using
it no longer allow "embed", "object", "param", or "iframe" tags. If you do not
disable these tags, all embedded content will be passed to visitors unfiltered
(if that's what you want, disregard this message).
1. Go to Administration > Site Building > Modules and uncheck the box labeled
   "MyTube".
2. If you wish to remove all of MyTube's settings, proceed to the tab labeled
   "Uninstall", check "MyTube", and click the "Uninstall" button to confirm.
3. Only after performing these steps should you delete the
   sites/all/modules/mytube folder.
